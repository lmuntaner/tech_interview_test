### JavaScript

#### Getting Set Up

Before going over the exercises you need to set up your environment. There are only 2
things needed for these exercises: Node.js and NPM.

JavaScript has traditionally been used as a client-side scripting language since it is
the only language currently supported in web browsers, but it can also be used on the
server using _Node.js_.

##### Mac OS

We recommend using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/index_ca.html) to install Node on Mac OS.

Then in order to install Node just execute `brew install node` from the command line.
This will also install `npm` which is the package manager for Node.

##### Windows

To install Node.js and NPM for Windows you can go directly to http://nodejs.org or follow
[these steps](http://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/node-windows.html).

#### "Hello, World!" in JavaScript

Let's create a ["Hello, World!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)
program in JavaScript.

1. Navigate to a folder.
1. Create a new JavaScript file named `helloworld.js`.
1. Open the file with your text editor.
1. Insert the following code into the file: `console.log('Hello, World!')`
1. Save the file.
1. Navigate to the folder with the terminal. Once you are there, run `ls` to make sure you see your file.
1. Run `node helloworld.js` from the terminal.
1. You should see "Hello, World!" printed on the screen.

Congratulations! You created your first JavaScript program!
